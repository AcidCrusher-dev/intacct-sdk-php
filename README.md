# Sage Intacct SDK for PHP


## ⚠️ Deprecation Notice ⚠️  

As of **Sage Intacct 2025 Release 1** (February 2025), the **REST API** are **Generally Available (GA)**.  
With this, we are **no longer actively developing enhancements** for the XML SDKs.  

Developers can continue using the SDKs, but any future changes, maintenance, and feature development will be **self-managed**.  
For new integrations, we strongly recommend using the [REST API](https://developer.sage.com/intacct/docs/).

For any questions, refer to our [developer support](https://developer.sage.com/intacct/docs/developer-portal/rest-api-faq/).
